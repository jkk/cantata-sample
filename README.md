# Cantata Sample

A playground sample project for the [Cantata](https://github.com/jkk/cantata) Clojure library.

It uses an adapted version of the Sakila database from MySQL, which models a movie rental store:

## Usage

Clone the repo. Launch a Clojure REPL for the project according to your tastes. Then:

```clj
(require '[cantata.core :as c])
(require '[cantata-sample.core :refer :all])
(import-data! ds)

;; Example
(c/query
    ds [:from :film
        :select [:title :language.name]
        :where [:= "Canada" :renter.country.country]])
```

For more queries to try, see [core.clj](https://github.com/jkk/cantata-sample/blob/master/src/cantata_sample/core.clj).

By default, an embedded H2 database is used. MySQL and PostgreSQL schemas are also included but require databases to be set up:

MySQL:

```
$ mysql
mysql> create database film_store;
mysql> grant all on film_store.* to 'film_store'@'localhost' identified by 'film_store';
```

PostgreSQL (when prompted, enter "film_store" (without quotes) as password):

```
$ createuser -P film_store
$ createdb -O film_store film_store
```

Changes made to Sakila:

* Removed `last_update` field from all tables
* Removed `picture` field from staff
* Created a `store_manager` table to avoid cyclic dependency between store and staff
* Renamed all PKs to `id`
* Culled rows by about 50%
